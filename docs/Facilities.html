<h5>What is the trend of sqaure foot utilization by decade and Program?</h5>
<p>Exchange Operations, Children and Youth and Semper Fit programs have been adding additional square footage utilization throughout the 2000 and 2010 decades (2000 - 2019). Additionally, Clubs, Commercial Recreation and less so in Lodging from the 2000 to the 2010 have slowed adding additional square footage within their programs. While Food and Beverage (Direct) and Other Business Operations have remained relatively flat.</p>

<p>How to read a boxplot:</p>
<p><img src="images/boxplot4.png" /> <br></p>
<p>The box and whiskers chart shows you how your data is spread out. Five pieces of information (the “five number summary“) are generally included in the chart:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The minimum (the smallest number in the data set). The minimum is shown at the far left of the chart, at the end of the left “whisker.”</p></li>
<li><p>First quartile, Q1, is the far left of the box (or the far right of the left whisker).</p></li>
<li><p>The median is shown as a line in the center of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Third quartile, Q3, shown at the far right of the box (at the far left of the right whisker).</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum (the largest number in the data set), shown at the far right of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Inter-quartile Range (IQR): The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. To find the interquartile range (IQR), first find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data. These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.</p></li>
<li><p>If outliers are present, the whisker on the appropriate side is drawn to 1.5 * IQR rather than the data minimum or the data maximum. Black filled circles are used for known outliers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>use_code:</strong> A five-digit system of numbering a common nomenclature for classes 1 and 2 plant property. See NAVFAC P-72, Department of the Navy Facility Category Codes, for a listing of recognized codes.</p>
<p><strong>use_desc:</strong> The title of the use category associated with the Category Use Code (use_code) derived from the Appendix A - Category Codes for Navy and Marine Corps Real Property Replacement for NAVFAC P72.</p>
<p><strong>fac_use:</strong> Identifies the use of a Navy or Marine Corps facility (or portion thereof).</p>
<p><strong>PRV:</strong> PRV is the cost to replace an existing facility with a generic facility that can perform the same function(s). The notional replacement facility is generally understood to be the same size and to occupy the same site as the existing facility. The notional replacement facility is also assumed to be constructed to current standards of materials and design. Since each facility has its own theoretical PRV, no facility PRV should contain costs associated with any other facility. Therefore, PRV costs are considered to extend only to the five-foot line surrounding the facility. This estimate applies to all facilities regardless of funding source and does not include land or leasing costs. The PRV is calculated at the Use level and is based on the standard DoD algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plant Replacement Value = Facility Quantity<sup>1</sup>x Construction Cost Factor<sup>2</sup>x Area Cost Factor<sup>3</sup>x Historical Records Adjustment<sup>4</sup>x Planning and Design Factor<sup>5</sup>x Supervision Inspection and Overhead Factor<sup>6</sup>x Contingency Factor<sup>7</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>1</sup> The Facility Quantity is the sum total of assets at the Use/User level.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The Construction Cost Factor is the cost value for a specific DoD Facility Analysis Code (FAC) and is “unit of measure” specific. This value is stored in the Category Code Module and updated upon the annual release of the latest version of the DoD Facilities Pricing Guide from a spreadsheet provided by NAVFAC HQ.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The Geographical Area Cost Factor is a value carried on the city table. This value is stored in the RPI and updated at year-end from a spreadsheet provided by NAVFAC HQ.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> The Historic Records Adjustment Factor is an adjustment to account for increased costs for replacement of historical facilities or for construction in a historic district. The current factor is 1.05 and is based on the Historic/Heritage Asset data elements in iNFADS (DE 410a-d).</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The Planning and Design Factor accounts for the planning and design of a facility. The current value of this factor is 1.09 for all but medical facilities and 1.13 for medical facilities. Assignment of this factor is based on the Category Code Number of the Use/User record.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> The Supervision, Inspection and Overhead Factor accounts for the supervision, inspection, and overhead activities associated with the management of a construction project. The current value of the factor is 1.06 for facilities in the continental US (CONUS) and 1.065 for facilities outside of the continental US (OCONUS). Assignment of this factor is based on the Country Code and State Code.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The Contingency Factor accounts for construction contingencies; the current value of the factor is 1.05. PRV appears in the NAVFAC Public Works (Assessment) drills, Facility Maintenance Responsibility Report and various budget exhibits.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainment:</strong> Sustainment provides resources for maintenance and repair activities necessary to keep an inventory of facilities in good working order over a 50-year service life. It includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventive maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. It also includes major repairs or replacement of facility components that are expected to occur periodically throughout the facility life-cycle.</p>
<p>GENERAL POLICY FOR SUSTAINMENT 1. The work includes regular roof replacement, refinishing wall surfaces, repairing and replacing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar type work. When sustainment involves replacement of constituent parts, the items installed shall serve the same purpose.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sustainment does not include any construction. Sustainment does not include repairing or replacing non-attached equipment or furniture, or building components that typically last more than 50 years (e.g., foundation and structural members). Sustainment does not include repair work classified as restoration or modernization, environmental compliance, or historical preservation. Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are also not included.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacing landscaping destroyed by a sustainment project shall be classified as sustainment.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainment: The calculation in this report for Cat C utilizations is 2x iNFADS (FSM calculated Sustainment costs, for Cat A, Cat B and Lodging utilizations (FSM calculated sustainment costs)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Restoration and Modernization:</strong> Restoration and Modernization provides resources for improving facilities. Restoration includes repair and replacement work to restore facilities damaged by inadequate sustainment, excessive age, natural disasters, fire, accident, or other cases. Modernization includes construction or alteration of facilities solely to implement a new or higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (e.g., foundations and structural members).</p>
<p>GENERAL POLICY FOR RESTORATION AND MODERNIZATION</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Restoration and modernization does not include recurring sustainment tasks or certain environmental measures that are funded elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are also not included.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>R &amp; M: The calculation in this report is based on 2.5% of the facilities Plant Replacement Value (PRV), this calculation assumes facility is fully recapitalizaed and that sustainment costs are being applied annualy to each facility.</p>

<p><strong>Adequate Area Measure (adq):</strong> The capacity or size in area measure of a facility or portion thereof that is in adequate condition and associated with a designated function (use) and a designated user. Adequate is defined as being capable of supporting the designated function without a need for capital improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Adequate Other Measure (abq Other):</strong> The capacity or size in other measure of a facility or portion thereof that is in adequate condition and associated with a designated function (use) and a designated user.
