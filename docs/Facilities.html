<p>Total utilization of MCCS according to iNFADS is <strong>15,878,761</strong> square feet (Total Measure = adq + iadq + sub).</p>
<p><br> Note: Utilization such as athletic fields, outdoor playing courts(basketball, volleyball, etc), playgrounds and Marina/Boat Ramp's are typically not included in total measure of square foot utilization)</p>

<h5>What is the trend of sqaure foot utilization by decade and Program?</h5>
<p>Exchange Operations, Children and Youth and Semper Fit programs have been adding additional square footage utilization throughout the 2000 and 2010 decades (2000 - 2019). Additionally, Clubs, Commercial Recreation and less so in Lodging from the 2000 to the 2010 have slowed adding additional square footage within their programs. While Food and Beverage (Direct) and Other Business Operations have remained relatively flat.</p>
